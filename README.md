# Connectivty Map/LINCS Workshop

This repository contains notebooks from used in the Connectivity Map/LINCS 2020 workshop, hosted virtually on December 17 & 18, 2020. The notebooks will be reviewed during the workshop, but they are also posted here for reference. This repository will serve as a public resource of code demonstrating how to interact with and access CMap data stored in Google BigQuery, as well as other common formats such as [GCTx](https://clue.io/connectopedia/gctx_format).

The [Connectivity Map (CMap)](https://clue.io) project at the [Broat Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) is focused on generating a public resource of perturbational gene expression profiles that can be leveraged to accelerate functional hypothesis generation. This project is part of a larger NIH-funded effort called the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures [(LINCS)](https://lincsproject.org/).
